# Publishes the package to NuGet from inside the official .NET SDK image, so a release needs
# nothing installed locally beyond docker and works identically on any machine. The release
# workflow does the same steps on a tag; this is the manual path for a first release or when
# Actions is not an option.

#   NUGET_API_KEY=... ./scripts/publish.sh            # build, test, pack, push

#
# nuget.org attaches a trusted-publishing policy to an EXISTING package, so the first release has
# to use an API key from https://www.nuget.org/account/apikeys. After that the workflow can take
# the OIDC path and the key can be revoked.
#
# The SDK 10 image carries no .NET 8 runtime, so the net8.0 test binary is rolled forward onto the
# runtime that IS there. That also exercises the library on the current LTS, which is where most
# consumers will load it.
